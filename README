4. This application uses OpenId as authentication, for my tests I used https://www.myopenid.com/,
go there and get an account, confirm your account with the email you'll get and then when it's time
to login use the url that came in the email like http://username.myopenid.com

5. Start webrick running the following command
rails s

6. Go to http://localhost:3000, you'll be redirected to login, use the url that you got on the email
from myopenid.

7. Upload a tab delimited file and click on the "Import Data" button. You can use a sample file called test.csv that is located at 
APP_ROOT/spec/data/test.csv. It has 4 records with some duplications.

8. You'll see the Gross Revenue displayed after the import is processed. All the data is saved on the DB, you can check it using the rails
console.
